Description:  Interactive multimedia programming environment (NW.js variant)
 This is Jonathan Wilkes' nw.js variant of Pd-L2Ork, nick-named
 "Purr-Data". Basically, it is Pd-L2Ork with the Tk GUI replaced
 with a JavaScript GUI implemented using nw.js (http://nwjs.io/).
 .
 Pd-L2Ork is Linux Laptop Orchestra's (L2Ork) real-time visual
 programming environment for interactive multimedia. It also offers
 a unique K-12 educational module for teaching children basics
 about interactive instrument design, digital signal processing,
 and music.
 .
 Pd-L2Ork is used as the backbone of L2Ork's infrastructure. It
 has been also used in a number of MAKEr workshops, including
 work with like Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
 .
 Pd-L2Ork is a monolithic fork of Pure Data.
