Some things purr-data still lacks for full vanilla 0.53 compatibility, which
we might want to port in the future:

- pd fast-forward message (sched_fastforward, glob_fastforward)

- missing objects: file (low-level file operations), slop~ (slew-limiting
  low-pass filter), trace (message tracing)

- garray (edit and vis messages; messages to change style, width and color)

- list store (new and updated methods)

There might be more lurking in the shadows, but these are the ones that I
found in the release notes and can thus be considered official. -ag
