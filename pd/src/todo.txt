Some things purr-data still lacks for full vanilla 0.53 compatibility, which
we might want to port in the future:

- pd fast-forward message (sched_fastforward, glob_fastforward)
- slop~ (slew-limiting low-pass filter)

There might be more lurking in the shadows, but these are the ones that I
found in the release notes and can thus be considered official. -ag
