C:
*messages should be aware of $0?
*verbosity level for the console
*Draw SECONDARY redrect on gop scalar patchers to reflect the viewport?

*object synonyms do not instantiate until the main object has been instantiated (no solution--advise getting rid of aliases or making one monster startup setup routine)
*number2 should maintain focus after return to allow for entering next value (like regular number)
	*number and number2 arrow down/up should inc/dec value
*Add  netsend/receive~ for RPi objects to the RPi build IN PROGRESS
*Redesign main window interface
*add ability to custom name each instance of pd-l2ork (pd~?)
*shared sends and receives among multiple instances?
*scalar in a subpatch is visible even if it spills outside GOP (for legacy purposes we will keep this, and will hopefully fix this soon with the implementation of a window on a canvas)
*improve dialogs IN PROGRESS
*retrofit all 3rd-party gui objects to support tkpath
	*Scope~ window name "h16ffd10" already exists in parent (likely resize hook)
		*Change appearance of the resize hook
		*change to scope~?
	*clean-up ggee/gui
=====================================

Tkpath:
*Postscript not printing? (will switch to Qt, so not necessary)
*canvas_move should take into account transformations of children? (see Jonathan's email)
