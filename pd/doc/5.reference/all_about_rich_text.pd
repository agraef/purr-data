#X text 20 10 <h>Rich Text Formatting</h><#090><b>This</b> <#f69>is</#f69>
<s>normal</s> <#039><u>rich</u> <#909>text</#909>.This <i>only</i>
works in comments \, and uses special tags in the input text. Tags
come in pairs \, as they do in HTML \, '<!tag>' begins and '<!/tag>'
ends a specially formatted part of the text. Currently supported tags
are:• <!h><h>header text</h><!/h>  Typeset in bold at 120% size.•
<!b><b>bold text</b><!/b>• <!i><i>italic text</i><!/i>• <!u><u>underlined
text</u><!/u>• <!s><s>strike-through text</s><!/s>• <!red><red>colored
text</red><!/red>  The standard HTML color names and triplets can
be used as tags.Obviously \, this won't replace your word processor
anytime soon \, and entering all the formatting tags can get a bit
tedious. But at least it provides you with some useful formatting options.<b>NOTE:</b>
This entire text is in a single comment object \, so you can click
on this object in edit mode to reveal how it was formatted. To show
a tag as a literal in a comment \, as we did in the descriptions above
\, it can be escaped with a '!' immediately following the angle bracket
\, e.g.: '<!!tag>'.Please also note that none of the formatting tags
will work in vanilla Pd at present \, instead you will see the text
as shown while editing the comment box. Which doesn't look great \,
TBH \, thus rich text formatting is best avoided in patches that you
plan to use with vanilla Pd., f 66;
