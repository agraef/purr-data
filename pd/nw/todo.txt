Event settings for edit mode
----------------------------

1) No box - normal editmode behavior
   * moving/selecting
   * setting a bounding rect
   * mouse cannot select text
   * text is not editable
   * clicking a box triggers #2 below
2) Editing a box in place
  * x/y is set
   * can type inside box
   * can select text with the mouse
   * mouse motion doesn't change box position
   * applies to all boxes which already exist and are being edited
3) Editing a new box before it's anchored
   * x/y follows mouse
   * can type new text into the box
   * a click in the box will anchor the box and trigger #2 above

*need to be able to tell the difference between new obj and retexted
obj

HTML5 which may not be standard yet:
1) mouse.pageX/pageY -- exist in Chromium but maybe not in FF et al.
2) svg 'overflow' attribute -- probably doesn't work in other browsers
3) document.body.scrollTop (might be Chromium-specific, not sure)
4) document.body.scrollLeft (might be Chromium-specific, not sure)

Problems to put off until all (or most) sys_vgui calls are eliminated:
[x] gui-side parser inside -- pdgui.js
[ ] Semicolons -- currently the parser can't tell the difference between
    semicolons inside symbols and semicolons that end statements. Again,
    this will be easy to solve once we eliminate naked sys_gui altogether

Node-webkit stuff:
1) popup API
2) new window API
3) window menus
4) (probably) present working directory
5) command line argv

Everything else: (A [x] means we've fixed it)
[ ] packaging as app, setting correct appname, etc
[ ] check if patch windows with screenposition (0,0) get stuck underneath OSX
    menu.
[ ] abstract away appendChild
[x] font-size should be set as css property for a class of text, rather than
    per each gobj in svg
    (Note: not sure that this makes sense right now. We could use a class to
    set the "Pd font size" and do the actual sizing in CSS. But it's still
    going to be the same amount of work when the user changes the size in
    the font dialog.)
[ ] find a better approach to escaping characters for the gui than
    escape_double_quotes kludge (and handle any other problematic chars)
[ ] once garrays are drawn inside a <g> we won't have to individually erase
    each child of a scalar
[ ] make pdgui function names more consistent
[ ] in draw_vis, move tags to front of function call so they don't have to
    be in an array
[ ] for scalar tags, look into using "x" exclusively inside gui_vmess so that
    we don't have to sprintf anything. Then on the gui side we can
    concatenate as needed.
[ ] in draw_vis, remove all the coords logic and let svg_togui do that work.
    In svg_new, leverage the "d", "points", etc. methods to do the same.
[ ] remove the draw_vis warning/code about needing 2 points to draw
[ ] make gui_menu_close message less hacky (currently includes patch args in
    the middle) 
[x] make dialogs with [yes/no] instead of [cancel/ok]
[ ] draw graph inside gobj group
[ ] merge gui_text_select and gui_text_deselect
[ ] in function gui_cord_inspector_update, use parameter "moved" to flash text
[ ] cord_inspector_flash doesn't seem to be deterministic-- if you move among
    several cords very fast it will try to flash a non-existent svg item.
    (Probably want to either make a permanent item in the pd_canvas.html for it,
    or hard-code a separate div.)
[ ] looks like nwworkingdir isn't working for open/save dialogs atm
[x] text_set doesn't work when a numbox is first created (but works otherwise)
[x] clean up nw_create_window (doesn't need so many parameters)
[ ] make it possible to have the inner cells of hradio change color with the
    selection, as the border currently does.  Tk just uses the non-hierarchical
    tags and appends the word "BASE".  (Maybe use an inner <g> to do this.)
[ ] implement the crappy iemgui color dialog presets
[ ] use underscores for iemgui dialog element names
[ ] change all the gui color char[MAXPDSTRING] junk to simple int, and do the
    conversion to hex html string in the gui.
[ ] think about scaling the svg instead of the page, and making the selection
    rectangle a div above that
[ ] change 'visible-width' to 'cnv-width'
[x] in dialog_iemgui.html, use an object to store all the prop/value pairs that
    got sent.  That way we don't have to use all those awful tricks to
    conditionally fill the slots
[x] gui_graph_fill_border: use css class selectors instead of configuration
[ ] standardize javascript function names
[x] remove gui_text_select_color (css takes care of this)
[x] add a canvas message to set a transform on the patchsvg.  Good for:
    * obscure display needs (zooming past the browser limits)
    * rotating for a display
    * transforming or scaling all scalars on a patch at once
    However: This will require more math on the mousemotion.
    So this should probably wait until
    moving a lot of the editing code out of C and into the GUI
    (Note: interesting idea but not needed for now)
[x] change 'array_element_fill' to 'element_fill', array_outline to
    'array_element_outline' 
[x] either nw_create_window should take fewer parameters or it should take an
    object with name: value pairs
[ ] getting the sense that glist_isselected should _always_ have
    glist_getcanvas(x) as its first parameter
[ ] t_svg: change x_x1..y2 to simple x_bbox[4], and change current x_bbox to
    x_cachebbox (or something like that)
[ ] look into changing 'x' format specifier from \"x%.6lx\" to more generic
    \"%.6lx\". (Not exactly sure what good the "x" does there.)  It's only
    specified in s_inter and in editor_new, so it should be easy to amend
    if need be.
[ ] make "rtext" textarea <div> static, and turn display on/off
[x] for the clipboard shortcut keys inside pd_canvas.html keydown, not sure
    what code should be sent to Pd on keyup...
[ ] revisit pdtk_check_scroll_on_motion.  It's not implemented in the port
    yet.  Perhaps there's a better way to do it, without triggering a bunch
    of layouts.
[x] implement pdtk_canvas_editval and magicglassval
[ ] look into problems with object z-order on the C side when deleting objects
    and then undoing the delete
[x] implement magicglass edit menu indicator
[ ] clip garray to gl_x1 and gl_x2 by:
    a) checking if we're in a gop, and
    b) if so, only render if element number is > gl_x1 and < gl_x2
[ ] fix bug where utf_8 snowmen in an object box can cause a buffer overflow
    in the lib loading routine
[ ] Fix layout on dialogs so that height/width of the document doesn't
    reflow when the window gets resized
[ ] look into using requestAnimationFrame
[ ] canvas_check_geometry doesn't seem to do the right thing for canvases that
    are far to the right of the screen. Can't think of anything except maybe a
    bug in nw.js Window.x?
[x] look into using mask-image in order to make this background color theme-able
[x] integrate the inlet mouseover animation with a change of fill color
[ ] figure out difference between deb install location /usr
    vs tarball /usr/local
[x] port the bug fix from pd-l2ork git repo in commit
    6084c8e5f86d1521edde3a899a6d5b5821aa27c6
    "*fixed bug reported by Gilberto in..."
[x] gui_vmess: should it look like this:
        (void *x, "msg", "arg_format", ...)
    or as it currently looks, like this:
        ("msg", "arg_format", ...)
[x] same for "*fixed spaces in old UI objects that were converted to \t..."
    262447434c3548c53bc0b52e7f5bb5431b233311
    NB: this commit uses the vertical tab as a hack for putting spaces
    inside gatom labels. But I'm currently using vertical tab as a hack
    to delimit commands sent to the GUI.  So for now, this commit will
    will not get ported.
    (Note: doesn't seem like I need this. Spaces appear just fine inside
     gatoms.)
[x] same for "*fixed font positioning on 14.04+ releases"
    9edc6ca98e141174b86ebe5cdf406fe7e47845d5
    NB: this commit affects the old GUI.  Need to revisit it with the new
    one to see whether it's still necessary.
[x] same for all commits up to Jul 31, 2015
[x] 930414ea5a2330dfa5d581e92514ece05aca1ebf
    Has to do with font positioning inside objects boxes... probably
    need to address this manually.
[x] test if try/catch parser in the socket receiver is a performance hog. (For
    lots of data it can end up freezing the GUI. Test if requestAnimationFrame
    makes any difference...)
[ ] Figure out what pdtk_ping does
[x] Instead of hardcoded gui_post colors, set a class (warning, error, etc.)
[ ] revisit the function for escaping double-quotes inside s_inter.c, see
    if there's a cleaner way to do it
[ ] don't implement tooltips until we have a single call to create an object
    plus all xlets. That way we can add an arg or two for the name and dir
    to find the help patch and get all descriptions in one go
[ ] make scalars dig inside abstractions when they search the templatecanvas
    for drawing commands.  This will make it possible to build abstraction
    libraries for ds-gui widgets.
[ ] some menuitem shortcuts don't pass their events on to the dom, while
    others do. I think it happens when a double-modifier has keys in common
    with a single-modifier. Example: <ctrl-shift-v> creates a vsl, but the
    key gets sent to Pd. However, <ctrl-shift-h> creates an hsl, and
    does _not_ send a key to Pd. Since <ctrl-v> is bound to "paste" and
    <ctrl-h> isn't bound to anything, that may somehow be causing an
    inconsistency.
    After some more research, it appears this problem doesn't happen
    in OSX.
[x] fix ds-demos/splines.pd (arg number out of range)
[x] vsl dialog shows "undefined" for one of the tooltips

[x] set svg bounds to whatever the window size happens to be
[x] trigger a canvas_getscroll when the nw.js window is resized
[x] check if patch windows with screenposition (0,0) get stuck underneath
    Ubuntu menu.
[x] choosing the same directory multiple times doesn't work
    (see dialog API page)
[x] "Save As" on an overwrite doesn't seem to clear the dirty flag
[x] figure out why there is a "pd_opendir" global var
[x] pass k12 mode arg
[x] implement recent files (using Pd's prefs loading mechanism instead of
    reimplementing gui prefs). (Note: not needed-- native file dialogs
    have their own.)
[x] implement verifyquit
[x] save and saveas dialogs aren't defaulting to the present working directory
[x] implement automatic scrollbars and svg canvas resizing
[x] add 'x' type to gui_vmess for saving canvas names, etc., as hex values
[x] destroy (or, more likely, hide) selection rectangle when not needed
[x] change gui_text_select to gui_gobj_select
[x] make mycnv use its own selection logic
[x] remove the "fudge_factor" kludge in g_rtext.c, and handle fonts in a sane
    manner.  In doing so we must decide whether or not we want to be able to
    fetch the bounding box of objects from within a Pd patch.
    (Currently [canvasinfo] and [objectinfo] are the only objects that can
    do this, though there might also be some externals). Note: we just
    moved the kludge to the GUI.
[x] replace things like gui_select_color with css
[x] look into using <def> and <use> for scalars. (Looked into it-- doesn't
    seem necessary or helpful...)
[x] in draw_vis, make circle and ellipse radii attr floats instead of ints
[x] should stroke-dasharray values be floats? (Yes.)
[x] clean up svg_sendupdate -- put a single gui_vmess at the end (not necessary
    for now)
[x] svg_sendupdate -- make sure there aren't arbitrary %d's that should actually
    be %g's
[x] svg_sendupdate -- need a gui interface for stuff like stroke-dasharray
    (and garrays)
[x] ibid., for path data, points
[x] need to clean up dead windows inside patchwin object (on close)
[x] make a gui_mess interface for the edge cases that don't require args
    (similar to sys_gui) (not necessary)
[x] make sure we're breaking down the socket properly from the GUI side on quit
[x] nwworkingdir only works on the second file open
[x] implement the stuff at the end of saveas_callback (recentfiles et al)
[x] make an "export" menu command for max patch saving.  That way we can accept
    a single extension for saving (.pd), and the native save dialog will warn
    us on potential file overwrites (even when the user neglects to type an
    extension). (Note: this was solved by putting a ".pd" extension in the
    saveas name by default.)
[x] for data structure demos, change "" to 'none'
[x] fix "Reselect" <ctrl-Enter> Keybinding.  It doesn't work atm because nw.js
    cannot bind to Enter. But canvas_events should make this pretty easy.
[x] fix bug where Reselecting a floating text doesn't stop it from floating
[x] keyup doesn't register autokeypresses, but keyname and key do
[x] make a nice window API in C.  Window "foo-bar" type maps to "foo-bar.html"
[x] find a simple translation API
[x] revisit the x_thick logic in g_slider.c.  It thickens the indicator when
    it's in the middle of the slider, but it's pretty obscure in the current
    implementation.
[x] for as many items as possible, hide them instead of removing from DOM
[x] fix iemgui_font so it doesn't use tcl list syntax
[x] implement iemgui labels and its ascetic font chooser
[x] look into the font metrics, see if we can use floating point fonts to
    simplify things
[x] iemgui font configuration -- de-tcl-ize the {fontface fontsize} tcl list,
    then make it work
[x] do msg box click animation in css
[x] tgl 'X' doesn't show up
[x] in gui_plot_vis, we have to check for gobj existence.  For some reason, at
    very fast drawing rates we end up with two svg elements if we don't check
    for this.  This would be simplified if gop stuff was just children of
    parent <group>
[x] add garray_update for changing the path coords without having to recreate
    the entire scalar edifice
[x] get rid of the old tcl specific sys_get_audio_apis
[x] have a single function to set t_svg_attr
[x] figure out why gatom_retext sends a fill color to GUI
[x] what to do about character sets other than utf-8 that come from Pd
    side? Example: ISO-8859 from the string posted by hexloader.c
[x] revis message box after updating the text in the editor. We didn't have
    to do this with the old API because it updated the box on every keystroke.
    But we're doing an end-run around that entire edifice so we need to
    force it, probably inside text_setto
[x] abstract out multi-line text loop, use for text_new and text_set
[x] set svg viewBox/width/height to the window size when window gets created
[x] move crispEdges value to CSS
[x] ds-demos unit-circle node throws an "unexpected string" error when
    trying to open it
[x] gui_canvas_getscroll isn't called upon patch load
[x] sprite-game character tears when moving around
    This appears to be related to a problem with my graphics card on the X60.
    The SVG stacked-sprite I'm using isn't super efficient, but it should
    perform ok for simple graphics.
[x] when mapping inside a new nw window, sometimes it stops rendering
    the svg, or the svg becomes corrupted.
    * when you drag the nw window, it will update the svg contents
    * sometimes parts of the window aren't rendered
    * sometimes the rendering is buggy (part of a gobj rect
      appears/disappears mysteriously)
    (This appears to be a problem with the graphics card on my X60 as other
     GUI progs seem to be having problems with updating the display)
[x] sometimes straight control cords are pixel-aligned, sometimes they aren't.
    (If not pixel-aligned, try nudging one pixel to the right and they become
    non-aligned.)
[x] work on resizing dialog windows to the document content (currently some do,
    some don't)
[x] add Mac support by changing evt.ctrlKey to evt.ctrlKey||evt.metaKey
[x] when editing message box contents, the background svg image is hardcoded
    with a border color of blue.
[x] make a css entry for colors for the new_object_textentry border, background,
    and cursor
[x] control main object font color from css
[x] check new_object_textentry on editmode change
[x] check if [key] and [keyup] handle autorepeat the same way
[x] same for 50719c4c455291be3ac679486f7e4d72706bd9e4
    (note: we didn't update the major/minor release
     macros to 0.43 here.)

    Need to patch this manually, as gnu patch fails for some reason
[x] 95bb59b246fbcca3faf05b8bc06e77319fd9e6a5
    Hunks failed.  Need to patch manually.

[x] 60e06b3155458b561f3fb1ace17874eac9c5592a
    Hunks failed.  Patch manually.
[x] address double-free when closing a canvas that is a canvas field
    of a scalar
[x] create a function in pdgui to change ["name", value] arrays to Javascript
    objects.  This will greatly simplify things like dialog_iemgui.html
[x] make pdsend able to take an arbitrary number of arguments
[x] the outlet of [group] doesn't get reordered correctly when adding [inlet]
    inside the subpatch.  It's supposed to always be the rightmost one, but
    it stays to the left.  Either figure out how to fix it or how to get
    the [group] inlet to always stay at the left so that the two behave the
    same.
    to always be the rightmost outlet
[x] make sure to free events in svg_free
[x] getscroll_var assumes we're only loading a single patch at a time, but
    that isn't true. Thus if we open many patches at a time, the getscroll
    call for the most recent window will cancel the old one, leaving the 
    older window with the wrong viewport.
[x] make GUI server try again if the port is already in use
[x] figure out why OSX app bundle runs when using "open" from the terminal,
    but not when you click it
[x] revisit cursor logic-- when you leave the boundaries of an object 
    being dragged, for example, the cursor changes to whatever is set for
    the parent (svg, document, etc.).
[ ] Consider:
    [pd foo]
    |
    [print]

    1) Go inside [pd foo] and clear the [outlet]
    2) In the [pd foo] window, click "Undo" in the menu
    3) Bug!  Notice that the connection between [pd foo]---[print] does
       not get recreated. I also noted that it isn't just a drawing
       problem-- the connection doesn't happen at all in Pd.
[ ] currently you can't send a message to the GUI with a single
    array parameter:
    gui_start_vmess("some_message", "");
    gui_start_array();
    gui_s("hello world");
    gui_end_array();
    gui_end_vmess();

    Will output:
    "some_message ,[\"hello world\"]"
    which will cause a parser error

    Practically, this isn't a big deal since most messages to the GUI
    require a leading parameter before the array is sent.

Differences in Purr Data and Pd
---------------------------

When editing box content, you cannot currently trigger xlet highlight when
mousing over xlets.  This is a consequence of the current iteration of moving
gui behavior from the core to the GUI.

When editing box content, the text will wrap if it gets close to the right
border of the window.  (Probably same for the bottom of the window.) But
when you activate the box the svg text still gets rendered in the correct
location.  (I see this as an improvement over the old behavior.)
