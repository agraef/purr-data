0) Important stuff at the beginning
===================================

Please be aware that the build system might have difficulties handling paths with spaces.
Under unix you might get along with escaping your\ path or quoting "your path".
Under Windows escaping doesn't work at all and quoting might not work either - therefore it's
best not to use spaced paths at all.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Using the flext build system
===============================

flext provides a universal build system which supports

- various operating systems
	Windows (win)
	Linux (lnx)
	MacOSX (mac)
- various real-time systems
	Pure Data (pd)
	Max/MSP (max)
- various make programs
	GNU make (gnumake)
	Microsoft nmake (nmake)
- various compilers
	Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0, .NET 2002/2003/2005/2008 (msvc)
	GNU gcc 2.95 and above (gcc,cygwin,mingw)

Useful combinations of the above are

under Windows:
pd msvc, using nmake
pd cygwin, using GNU make
pd mingw, using GNU make (from the CMD prompt, not msys!)
max msvc, using nmake
max cygwin, using GNU make
max mingw, using GNU make (from the CMD prompt, not msys!)
pd bcc, using Borland make

under Linux or MacOSX:
pd gcc, using GNU make

under MacOSX:
max gcc, using GNU make - Mach-O externals only (Max 4.5 upwards)


There are two central scripts in the flext folder which invoke the building process:
- build.sh for bash shells (Linux, MacOSX, cygwin)
- build.bat for the Windows command prompt

A project needs to provide some information in order to be built properly.
By default, this resides in a file called package.txt


Please note, that the build system is shell-oriented, which means, that you'll have
to launch a command prompt (cmd.exe under Windows) and probably also set some
environment variables for your development system (e.g. run vcvars32.bat included with Microsoft Visual Studio)

By invoking one of the build scripts (e.g. with "bash build.sh" under unix, 
or just "build" unter Windows) you'll get some lines of help.
Operating System, real-time system and compiler need to be provided as arguments.


See buildsys/readme.txt for developer-centered information.


1.1) Prerequisites
==================

Linux:
- A gnu g/g++ compiler should be present on any system. 
  The command "g++ --version" should show version 2.95 at least. Compiler version >= 3.3 is recommended.

OSX:
- The developer package must be installed which contains all necessary parts.

Windows:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 6, .NET 2002/2003/2005/2008
  Be sure to use the VCVARS32.BAT (or probably SDKVARS.BAT) command on the prompt to set up the environment variables
  Also be sure NOT to put flext or other externals into a path containing spaces!!
or
- cygwin with binutils, gcc and make packages

Max:
- The Max/MSP SDK must be installed. On OSX, the frameworks therein must be copied to /Library/Frameworks


1.2) Building and installing flext
==================================

Flext can build itself using the build system.
From the flext main directory, run the build script

e.g. under Windows
	build pd msvc
or under unix with
	bash build.sh pd gcc

When you run it for the first time, one or more configuration files will be created 
from templates - you will get a message on the console. 
You should edit the files to adapt it to your system.

Depending on your platform these will have name like
buildsys/config-win-pd-msvc.txt
or
buildsys/config-lnx-pd-gcc.txt
or
buildsys/config-mac-max-gcc.txt


After editing the files you will have to run the build script again to ensure that flext is built.

After successfully building everything, you can install flext with (under Windows)
	build pd msvc install
or (under unix)
	bash build.sh pd gcc install


You will probably have to have superuser rights in order to install things 
into the default location.
(try "sudo" or "su -c" prefixes, or log in as root)


1.3) Building externals
=======================

The flext build system can be used to compile flext-based externals or also
native PD and Max/MSP externals, provided there is a package.txt file in the project folder.

In the shell, change to the project folder.
Then, simply run the flext build script, 

e.g. under Windows
	..\flext\build pd msvc
Then install your newly built external with
	..\flext\build pd msvc install
You can clean up the intermediate build folders with
	..\flext\build pd msvc clean

or under unix with
	bash ../flext/build.sh pd gcc
Then install your external with
	bash ../flext/build.sh pd gcc install
You can clean up the intermediate build folders with
	bash ../flext/build.sh pd gcc clean


1.4) Tested configurations
==========================

Both flext and flext-based externals have been successfully built with the 
following combination of platform-system-compiler, build type.
A missing combination does not necessarily mean that it won't work.

win-pd-msvc, single/multi/shared
win-pd-bcc, single/multi/shared
win-pd-mingw, single/multi/shared (from CMD prompt, not MSYS)
win-pd-cygwin, single/multi/shared
win-max-msvc, single/multi/shared
win-max-cygwin, single/multi/shared
win-max-mingw, single/multi/shared


mac-pd-gcc, single/multi/shared
mac-max-gcc, single/multi/shared

lnx-pd-gcc, single/multi/shared

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Using autoconf
=================

Thanks to Tim Blechmann, flext can also be built using autoconf.
This only works under unix shells (like bash).

When starting from a fresh cvs-based copy of flext first run
./bootstrap.sh

then you can run
./configure --help 
to get a page of options.

You need to pass the path to the PD source files or the Max SDK to the ./configure script, 
e.g. on OS X with something like
./configure --enable-system=pd --with-sysdir=/Applications/Pd-0.40-2/Contents/Resources/src

then build flext with
make

and install it with
sudo make install


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MINGW: the specs file for certain gcc versions seems to be wrong and needs to be fixed before building flext

- locate the specs file with "gcc --print-file specs"
- open this file with your favourite editor
- search for the line "*md_startfile_prefix:"
- change the next line "/mingw/lib" to "/lib"
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Other ways to compile flext and flext-based externals
========================================================

Flext can be compiled straightforward as a static or shared library, in release or debug mode.

Some preprocessor symbols must be defined depending on the build mode and the realtime system it is targetted for.

for Max/MSP: FLEXT_SYS = 1
for PD: FLEXT_SYS = 2

for a debug build: FLEXT_DEBUG

for a static single-threaded library: nothing needs to be defined
for a static multi-threaded library: FLEXT_THREADS
for a shared library (always multi-threaded): FLEXT_SHARED



- Windows - Microsoft Visual Studio projects (.vcproj files)

    Please have a look at the projects delivered with flext and flext-based externals.

- MacOSX - Apple Xcode projects (.xcode bundles)

    Please have a look at the projects delivered with flext and flext-based externals.

    Xcode projects often use some Source Trees (definable in the Xcode Preferences).
    - Flext - the flext main folder
    - PD - the PD installation
    - Max SDK - the Max SDK (path ending with "c74support")
    - Max Common - Max common files (normally /Library/Application\ Support/Cycling\ \'74 )

- MacOSX - Metrowerks Codewarrior (.mcp files)

    You should have the following "Source Trees" (CW preferences, not project specific!) defined:
    "OS X Volume" - Pointing to your OSX boot drive
    "flext" - Pointing to the flext main directory
    "Cycling74 OSX" - Pointing to the SDK for Max/MSP - the path should end with /c74support

    With your project using flext use the prefix file "flcwmax-x.h" or, 
    alternatively "flcwmax-x-thr.h" for threading support.

- MacOS9 - Metrowerks Codewarrior (.mcp files)

    You should have the following "Source Trees" (CW preferences, not project specific!) defined:
    "flext" - Pointing to the flext main directory
    "Cycling74" - Pointing to the Cycling 74 SDK
    "MP SDK" - Pointing to the Multiprocessing SDK (for threading support)

    With your project using flext use the prefix file "flcwmax.h" or, 
    alternatively "flcwmax-thr.h" for threading support.
