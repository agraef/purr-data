- fixed bug with hard thread termination (of incooperative threads)

0.4.2:
- started port for jMax
- moved CLASS_MAINSIGNALIN to class scope (fixed "float method overwritten" warning)
- unix makefiles: CXX should be commented out if standard (to enable environmental settings)
- introduced default returns for the different flext::GetA* functions
- pragma for Metrowerks compilers: enumsalwaysint on, bool on

- added new POSIX for ThrCond::TimedWait (but still have to find out when to enable it....)
- added CopySamples and ZeroSamples

0.4.1:
- full port for Max@OSX
- completely redesigned message and attribute handling: now hashed and much more efficient
- greatly enhanced object creation and destruction (esp. for library objects)
- class setup functions now take t_classid type arg... this is BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE for Max/MSP
- added some prerequisites for usage of flext as a shared library
- completed Max/MSPs inlet/outlet assist description functionality
- Max/MSP signal objects: fixed bug of reporting wrong number of inlets
- put overloaded new/delete into flext support class
- introduced "Finalize" virtual method, called after all "Init" methods
- fixed crash issue in flext_dsp when there are NO signal inlets or outlets defined
	(this is possibly only a problem for the signal2 tutorial example)
- added flext::GetType(t_atom &), flext::ZeroMem
- put the clock_delay for the message queue inside the thread-locked area
	Ok for the actual object, but PD has to be thread-safe here as well
- BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: flext_base::m_methodmain and flext_base::m_method_ have got 
	const modifiers.... these virtual methods are used rarely (except for example in py/pyext)
- now MUCH cleaner platform identification... FLEXT_SYS,FLEXT_OS,FLEXT_CPU definitions
- also FLEXT_DEBUG for debug build
- SndObjs: virtual FreeObject routine is now called at destruction (by parent class), derived class doesn't need to call it!
- SndObjs: fixed typo (numbers of output slots was wrong) and init bug
- STK: added support for STK object classes (flstk.{h,cpp})
- introduced a helper thread for launching flext threads in the background
- threads are now handled on class (as opposed to object) level
- threads can now be terminated separately
- put more flext functions into flext static class
- replaced ChangePriority by RefPriority
- fixed setting of priorities...  problems were caused by a compiler bug (MSVC 6)
- made a portable threading interface with support for threading libraries other than pthreads (FLEXT_THREADS defined as FLEXT_THR_*)
- implemented threading support with the MacOS MP thread library
- stripped the ThrMutex and ThrCond classes of non-portable (and irrelevant) functionality
- simplified "ToQueue*" and threaded "ToOut*" message queue mechanism for Max/MSP 
- deprecated FLEXT_ADDMETHOD_V and FLEXT_ADDMETHOD_A definitions which only lead to confusion
- BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: flext_sndobj::NewObjs must return a boolean!!

0.4.0:
- the use of the const keyword is enforced (e.g. the preferred type for symbols is now "const t_symbol *")
	- there _might_ be some problems with sensitive compilers
- introduced Max/Jitter-like attribute functionality ("@value" command line, "getvalue" get and "value" set functions)
- introduced a flext static class for general flext functions (to clean up the flext_base class)
- creation argument handling is now done by flext
	no more weird PD re-ordering of arguments 
- no more support for the Apple MPW compiler - MacOS9 is dying anyway...
- calling SetupInOut() has become obsolete 
	- flext creates all inlets/outlets by itself after the constructor has finished
	- this implies that CntIn(),CntOut() and the outlet pointers are not valid in the constructor
	- there is a virtual bool Init() function that may be used for such initialization
- completely redesigned FLEXT_NEW macros, usage of dynamic classes (in fllib.cpp)
- added ToQueue* functions - like ToOut* but messages or not directly sent (well suited for deadlock situations)
- introduced additional per-class methods and attributes (just like it ever was in Max and PD)
- fixed potentially dangerous typo in flext.cpp - (was: FLEXT_THREAD instead of FLEXT_THREADS)
- added OSX/darwin support (originally done by Adam T. Lindsay)
- SndObj interface now also available for cygwin and BCC 
- added prepend and append functions to AtomList class
- added IsNothing, SetNothing, CanbeBool and GetABool functions
- eliminated the remaining Get*Flint and Set*Flint functions 
- added/completed Is/Canbe/Get/Set for pointer atoms
- added print/scan functions for atoms
- fixed anything outlets for Max/MSP... for some strange reason this severe bug has not had severe consequences....

0.3.3:
- PD: fixed bug for DSP objects having no signal inlets
	this also enables floats into a non-signal leftmost inlet
- revisited priority stuff for detached threads
- Bind/unbind functions for flext classes (in MaxMSP only one object can be bound)
- made "t_symtype" another synonym for "t_symbol *"
- added forgotten dsp_free function for MaxMSP
- fixed forgotten __class__ member for MaxMSP libraries
- changed basic MaxMSP object to t_pxbox (ok, a bit more memory is used....)
- MaxMSP library can now be loaded from startup folder (but can't use aliases)

- added buffer resize functions flext_base::buffer::Frames(int,bool)
- added some utility functions: Sleep, CopyAtom, CopyList
- added List manipulation classes: AtomList, AtomAnything
- Alias object names (simply specify with FLEXT_NEW*, separated by whitespace)
- float messages - int method is called if there is no float method
- MaxMSP: int messages - float method is called if there is no int method
- fixed type warning for class constructors with int arguments in PD
- fixed severe bug concerning symbol methods
- MaxMSP: use critical sections for message output (for more safety in overdrive mode)
- PD: default/manual definition of help file by flext_base::DefineHelp
- added GetThing/SetThing to access t_symbol's s_thing data member

- introduced FLEXT_NEW_DSP* and FLEXT_LIB_DSP* for FLEXT_NEW_TILDE* and FLEXT_LIB_TILDE* (the latter become deprecated)
- all variable argument defs (aka gimme) now have a V instead of G  (e.g. FLEXT_NEW_V)

0.2.3:
- restructured files and started usable inline documentation
- found that there was no method to output a bang?! Ugh! -> corrected
- finally eliminated awful t_flint type and all other schizophrenic flint functions (float and int exist now equally)

- added AddInBang/AddOutBang (same as Add*Symbol - unchecked)
- buffer class: added "bool Ok()" check function
- switched on error posting for unhandled messages

- changed dynamic casts in callback functions to static as gcc 3.0.4 has obvious bugs

0.2.1:
- fixed bug in message parsing code (anything messages were not correctly mapped to inlets)
- changed t_symtype to t_symptr (= t_symbol *), needed for method argument lists
- eliminated flint type (t_flint remains)

0.2.0:
- internal proxy objects for any non-leftmost inlets
- Max/MSP: all signal inlets can receive messages
