* KNOB 

Version: 0.3

"knob" is a gui external for PD based on the IEMGUI-vslider included in PD.

Knob is available at http://footils.org (soon)

It was written by Frank Barknecht with help by Olaf Matthes reusing very much
IEM code by Thomas Musil.

CHANGELOG

Version: 0.3
- Loadbang works
- Works with Pd-0.36

Version: 0.02
- Olaf Matthes made an external out of the previous patch to the PD sources and
  wrote the makefile.  Still you need the sources of PD in reach, to build the
  external as some non standard headers in the source are used.

- While moving the knob, the dial line is now in the correct position.


* INSTALLATION

Edit the "makefile" and put the correct path to the pd-sources at the top.
Then on Linux just issue "make"

* BUGS

Apart from the dirty code, a serious bug is, that knob changes inlet-values a bit on
their way to the outlet. So don't expect another behaviour for now.
