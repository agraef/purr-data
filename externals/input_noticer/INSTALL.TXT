input_noticer install instructions
David Merrill <dmerrill@media.mit.edu>

In order to make this code compile, I had to install the following libraries
onto my system:

 libhal-dev
 libglib2.0-dev
 libdbus-glib-1-dev

In a debian-based system, they can be installed with apt-get, as in:
 sudo apt-get install libhal-dev

To see if you have the right libraries installed in order to compile, you can
try compiling the test_noticer.c file, by running the test_noticer_compile.sh
shell script, as follows:

source test_noticer_compile.sh

Then, run test_noticer, and when it's running you should see messages when 
you plug, or un-plug a joystick.

Once you've got your libraries sorted out, to compile and install, you should
first modify the Makefile to suit your system. Then you can type:

make pd_linux
make install_noticer
