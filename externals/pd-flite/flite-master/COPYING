Flite is free software.

We have kept the core code to BSD-like copyright, thus the system is
free to use in commercial products, with commercial extensions.  GPL
code is only included as part of the build process and does not
taint any of the run-time code.  

As a collection it is distributed under the following license.  Note
a few files in this distribution have a different but equally free
non-conflicting licence, see below.
