Changelog for Makefile.pdlibbuilder.

v0.6.0, dated 2019-12-21
- detect target platform (OS and architecture) rather than build platform (#55)
- introduce optional user variable 'PLATFORM' for cross compilation
- no longer build OSX/MacOS fat binaries by default (#21, #50)
- do build fat binaries when 'extension=d_fat' is specified for OSX/MacOS
- fix bug where minimum OSX/MacOS version wasn't defined, and set it to 10.6

v0.5.1, dated 2018-03-15
Fixes and improvements for Windows builds:
- properly evaluate variables 'PDDIR' and 'PDBINDIR' to find pd.dll
- define default path of 32 bit Pd on 64 bit Windows
- link C++ externals with standard C libs on Windows, they don't load otherwise
- strip installed Windows binaries by default
(issues #34, #39, #41, #42 respectively)
Warning for all platforms: variable 'PD_PATH' is no longer supported, use the
equivalent 'PDDIR'.
