version history for shoutamp~

v0.5 (2003/04/02)
- added a small fix to empty buffer for incoming mp3 data
  when doing a reconnect

  ments and droputs: the input buffer was too small (thanks
  Alex for pointing me to that!)


v0.5 beta (2002/09/08)
- BUG: short audio dropout (they happen more often if the Pd
  console window is the foreground window)
