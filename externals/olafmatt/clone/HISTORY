version history for clone

v 0.0.6 (2002/09/23):
- added loadbang for abstractions
- fixed a bug with list input
- MAC OS X port (Darwin 10.1.5)
- BUG:: seems to crash Pd after some hours when using DSP obejct 
  in the abstraction (or when DSP is on in general?)

v 0.0.5 (2002/09/23):
- increased number of signal inlets / outlets to 8 each
- fixed a memory leak in clone_connective.c
- some more bugfixes / error handling
- updated / corrected help patches
- PDF readme

v 0.0.4 (2002/09/22):
- added method for symbol into all control (proxy) inlets
- rewrote dsp-routine to handle various inlet/outlet combinations
  more efficiently
- first signal and control inlet both get their own inlet
- changed internal in and out names to 'clone*' to avoid an internal
  nameclash with rabin~

v 0.0.3 (2002/09/22):
- added support for multiple signal (up to 2) and control outlets
  (up to 256) and any arbitrary combination of them
- added method for float: it gets sent to all instances
- now using unique receive names allowing for multiple instances of
  clone (format: clone_rcv_<instancenumber>_<outletnumber>)
- added preppended instance id number for control outlets: data sent
  to an abstraction's outlet gets preppended with the instance number
  of that abstraction
- added support for multiple control inlets (same restrictions as for
  control outlets apply)
- added up to two signal inlets
- BUGS / LIMITATIONS:
  * order of outlets reflects order of creation, not order in terms 
    of position on canvas; signal outlets come first
  * first signal and first control inlet both share the leftmost inlet
    of clone!

v 0.0.2 (2002/09/21):
- added one signal outlet
- cleaned up code

v 0.0.1 (2002/09/20):
- first implementation based on Krzysztof Czaja's rabin~
- one control inlet and outlet possible
