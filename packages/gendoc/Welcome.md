# Purr Data @version@ @osname@ (@build-version@)

Purr Data was created by Jonathan Wilkes as a portable version of Ico Bukvic's Pd-l2ork. Pd-l2ork is a fork of Hans-Christoph Steiner's Pd-extended, which in turn is based on Miller S. Puckette's Pd. The included Pd abstractions and externals are the work of many people whose contributions are gratefully acknowledged.
